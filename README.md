I've created a modern, fully-featured phone book application with the following features:

Clean, professional UI with a gradient background
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
Full CRUD operations:
Add new contacts
Edit existing contacts
Delete contacts
Copy phone numbers to clipboard
Input validation and error prevention
Smooth animations and transitions
Hover states and visual feedback
Intuitive icons for all actions
Empty state handling
Accessible form labels and semantic HTML
The app uses a clean, modern design with subtle shadows and gradients. All actions have proper hover states and visual feedback. The table is responsive and includes proper spacing and typography.
